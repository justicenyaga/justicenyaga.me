Enhance your development environment and streamline your coding experience with this step-by-step walkthrough.\nThis post assumes that you have already installed Ubuntu within WSL2. If not, please do install it before proceeding.\nStep 1: Install Ubuntu Desktop and Mesa-utils # Begin by installing the Ubuntu Desktop and mesa-utils packages:\nsudo apt update sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop mesa-utils Troubleshooting for \u0026ldquo;Transport endpoint is not connected\u0026rdquo; error # If you encounter the error \u0026ldquo;Transport endpoint is not connected\u0026rdquo; during the setup, perform the following troubleshooting steps:\nPress Ctrl + C to skip packages with the error. Run the following commands: sudo mv /etc/acpi/events /etc/acpi/events.bak sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/system/acpid.service sudo ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/system/acpid.path Run the following command to reconfigure the unpacked packages that were skipped on the previous step.\nsudo dpkg --configure -a Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables # Configure environment variables for persistent settings.

In this guide, we\u0026rsquo;ll walk through setting up and enhancing your Tmux experience with a customized configuration.\nDesigned for efficient integration with Neovim, this carefully crafted configuration aims to streamline your terminal workflow. It provides a seamless and productive environment for both Tmux and Neovim enthusiasts. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a seasoned user or just diving into the world of terminal customization, this guide will help you unlock the full potential of Tmux in conjunction with Neovim. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive in!\nConfiguration Setup Step # Follow these steps to set up and enhance your Tmux experience:\nInstall Tmux:\nIf Tmux is not already installed on your system, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, run:\nsudo apt-get install tmux Verify the installation by checking the Tmux version:\ntmux -V Retrieve the Configuration File:\nDownload the Tmux configuration file and seamlessly integrate it into your home directory using the following command:\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justicenyaga/my_nvim_config/main/.tmux.conf -O ~/.tmux.conf Install Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm):\nClone the Tmux Plugin Manager repository to your local machine:\ngit clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm Create a Tmux session:\nStart a new Tmux session with a specific name (replace SessionName with your desired name):\ntmux new -s SessionName This should create a session and attach you to the created session.\nReload the Tmux configuration file:\nPress your Tmux prefix key (the configuration file uses Ctrl + N) followed by r to reload the configuration file:\n\u0026lt;C-n\u0026gt;r On the configuration file, replace C-n with a prefered key bind to override the default prefix key bind, on the following lines:\nset -g prefix C-n bind-key C-n send-prefix Install Tmux plugins:\nWhile inside a Tmux session, install plugins by pressing your Tmux prefix key followed by I (uppercase):\n\u0026lt;C-n\u0026gt;I Again, replace \u0026lt;C-n\u0026gt; with your configured prefix key bind. That\u0026rsquo;s it! Your Tmux environment is now configured with the specified settings and plugins. Customize further based on your preferences.\nUsage # Keybinds Explanation # Prefix Key: C-n\nThe prefix key is set to C-n for easier accessibility and to avoid conflicts with the default C-b. It\u0026rsquo;s a comfortable and ergonomic choice. Vertical Split: prefix + |\nThe keybind for vertical split is set to prefix + | for better visualization. The vertical bar (|) visually represents a vertical split, making it intuitive and memorable. Horizontal Split: prefix + -\nHorizontal split is initiated with prefix + -, providing a straightforward and balanced key combination for creating horizontal panes. Reload Configuration: prefix + r\nReloading the configuration is done with prefix + r, making it quick and easy to apply any changes made to the configuration file. Resize Panes: prefix + j/k/l/h\nResizing panes is streamlined with prefix + j/k/l/h for downward, upward, right, and left respectively. The mnemonic association with arrow keys makes it intuitive. Maximize Pane: prefix + m\nThe keybind prefix + m maximizes the active pane, providing a convenient way to focus on one task at a time. Enable Mouse Mode: prefix + M\nMouse mode is toggled with prefix + M, allowing for easy resizing and scrolling using the mouse. Copy Mode and Selection # Enter Copy Mode: prefix + [\nCopy mode is entered with prefix + [, initiating vi-style selection for efficient copying of text. Start Selection: v\nText selection starts with the v key in copy mode, following the vi-style conventions. Copy Selection: y\nThe selected text is copied using the y key in copy mode, mirroring vi-style copy operations. No Exit on Mouse Drag:\nDragging with the mouse in copy mode (MouseDragEnd1Pane) won\u0026rsquo;t exit copy mode, providing a seamless experience. Neovim Integration # No Delay for Exiting Insert Mode:\nThe delay for exiting insert mode with ESC in Neovim is removed (escape-time 10), ensuring a smooth transition. Tmux Plugins # Tmux Plugin Manager (tpm):\nThe Tmux Plugin Manager is initialized at the bottom of the configuration, allowing easy management of plugins. List of Plugins:\nvim-tmux-navigator: Navigate seamlessly between Vim and Tmux panes. tmux-themepack: A collection of themes for Tmux. tmux-resurrect: Persist Tmux sessions after computer restart. tmux-continuum: Automatically save sessions every 15 minutes. Theme: Powerline Cyan\nThe chosen theme from tmux-themepack is powerline/default/cyan for a visually appealing and distinctive look. Remember to customize these keybinds further based on your preferences and workflow!\n","date":"20-01-2024","permalink":"/posts/202401-my-tmux-configuration/","section":"Posts","summary":"Introduction # Welcome to the world of Tmux, where terminal multitasking becomes a breeze.
